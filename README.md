Nowadays, stroke is a major health-related challenge. Stroke, also known as cerebrovascular accident, consists of a neurological disease that can result from ischemia or hemorrhage of the brain arteries, and usually leads to heterogeneous motor and cognitive impairments that compromise functionality. 
Annually, stroke affects about 16 million individuals worldwide and is associated with enormous societal costs. 
WHO identifies ischaemic heart disease and stroke as the two leading causes of mortality and disability worldwide.
According to the American Heart Association, stroke is considered a severe health issue due to its high mortality rate.
